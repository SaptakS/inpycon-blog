<p><strong>How it works?</strong></p>
<p>Interested people register for an open space talk. A time slot is allocated, person gives a talk during the alloted time. Audience interacts and discusses sharing their opinions. Such small group discussions mostly turn out to be great.</p>

<p>PyCon India is one of <em>the</em> most affordable and entirely community run professional
conferences in India, and we strive to keep it that way. As much as we try, inflation
is just something that we can't do much about and hence, the small changes will reflect.
Here are the pricing tiers for this year's conference:</p>
<ol>
<li>Early Python          : Rs. 1000 (200 tickets. No cancellation. Transferable)</li>
<li>Regular Python        : Rs. 1500</li>
<li>Student Python        : Rs. 1000</li>
<li>On-the-spot Python    : Rs. 2500 (For two days)</li>
<li>Workshop Python       : Rs. 1000 Per workshop</li>
</ol>
<p>Tickets 1 to 4 gives you full access to the conference for two days, including breakfast,
 lunch, tea &amp; snacks and a T-shirt. The workshop ticket has to be bought separately for
each workshop that you want to attend. We'll announce them as soon as we finalize them.</p>
<p><a href="https://in.explara.com/e/pycon-india-2016">Get your tickets right away!</a></p>
<p>If you would like to talk Python at the conference, <a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2016/proposals/">take a look at our Proposal
submission page</a>. Put in a rough
draft right away. You can think about prettifying it later on. Submissions deadline is
on the 29th of June.</p>
<p>Cheers folks! Hope to see you at PyCon India!</p></div>
