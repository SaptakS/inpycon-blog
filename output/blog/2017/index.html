        <div><p><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow™</a> is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.</p>

        <div><p>Every year PyCon India team strives hard to put effort making the conference better for participants. The current edition of PyCon India stretches for four days. The first two days filled with workshops and dev sprints, and last two days comprising a different version of talks.</p>
<p>The last edition had six workshops, and this edition has sixteen workshops. More workshops are exciting news for participants and present audience to attend workshops from a broad category.</p>
<p>For past few days, a lot of our audience expressed interest in attending multiple workshops on two days, but the price is a show stopper. After considering the request, the revised ticket price is 750 INR + taxes. Hope this will help you to participate in more workshops. The current workshop ticket holders will get a refund in the difference of amount after revised ticket fare. You can write to contact at in dot pycon dot org for any inquiries.</p>

        <div><p>PyCon India is run by volunteer and there have been innumerable people from various python communities from various parts of India who deserve kudos for their efforts in running the event for past nine years. There have been requests from communities in the past for space which we regrettably could not fulfil due to space constraints. This year too a lot of communities have asked for an area in the venue to exhibit their work. We are excited to take this opportunity to invite communities that are contributing to the ecosystem of Python to showcase themselves, their projects and activities at PyCon India 2017.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to showcase your work at PyCon India:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take part in <a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/dev-sprint-2017/proposals/">Dev Sprint</a> by submitting a proposal.</li>
<li>Give a lightning talk aka flash talks.</li>
<li>Register for a slot in open spaces.</li>
<li>Register for a community space</li>
</ul>
<p>In the area earmarked for community space, a booth with a table and chairs for two representatives shall be setup for each selected community. We encourage the representatives to bring a standee, sticker and information brochures to spread awareness about their work and contribution to the open source world.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that people should be aware of every community that support and sustain the python ecosystem at large. We hope that this would help the community gain much needed exposure and find new contributors which in turn shall strengthen the ecosystem. And what could be a better place for this than the premier Python conference of India, PyCon India 2017.</p>

            <h1 class="title"> Understanding Open Spaces</h1>
        </a>
        <div class='meta'><time datetime="2017-08-29 11:00:00+05:30" itemprop="datePublished"><small>Published: August 29, 2017</small></time></div>

        <div><p>Pycon India is back! It’s time to meet some amazing Pythonistas, share their experiences and learn a ton from some really inspiring like-minded open source enthusiasts. We are happy to inform you that we have decided to continue with our tradition of open space this year as well. Open spaces are not only a great way to create a vibrant community but also a really useful mode of sharing knowledge and learning from the same.</p>
<h3>What is an Open Space?</h3>
<p>Literally, it's a SPACE OPEN to anyone who wishes to talk about Python. Be it experience, learnings, libraries, tools, frameworks, tests, correct code practices, an idea, a "What-not-to-do" talk or anything (in this case about Python).</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Interested people can register for an open space talk. A time slot is allocated, the concerned person gives a talk during the allotted time. Audiences interact and discuss, sharing their opinions. Such small group discussions mostly turn out to be great.</p>
<h3>Why to pre-register?</h3>
<p>Just to make arrangements for rooms, projectors and other such requirements. On-spot registration is also allowed, provided there is time slot availability.</p>
<h3>How to participate in Open Space?</h3>
<p>Simply register yourself on the <a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/">PyCon India CFP</a> when it's announced. Remember you can also just walk in during the conference.</p>
<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li>Allowed time slot for each talk is 15-30 minutes.</li>
<li>Reach the talk arena, 5 minutes before your talk starts.</li>
<li>Please specify your requirements for the talk in CFP description.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Proposal Sections</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python 3k</strong> - Features, Python 2 to 3 migration experience, Writing compatible 2 and 3 code</li>
<li><strong>Web Development</strong> - Web Development, API design etc ...</li>
<li><strong>Standard library</strong> - Python Standard library features, usage</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure</strong> - Automation, Deployment</li>
<li><strong>Network Programming</strong> - Socket programming, Async IO, Twisted, Gevent</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Unit Testing, Selenium, py.test, Nose</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - Web Security, Server Security, Cryptography, Encryption</li>
<li><strong>Data Visualization and Analytics</strong> - Visualizations, Statistics, Big Data</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Computing</strong> - Scientific/Numeric Libraries</li>
<li><strong>Concurrency</strong> - Parallel Processing, Async IO</li>
<li><strong>Embedded Python</strong> - Embedded Python, Device Interfacing, Robotics, Raspberry Pi, Arduino</li>
<li><strong>Others</strong> - Others</li>
<li><strong>Core Python</strong> - Language Features, Python Implementations, Standard Library, Algorithms, C APIs</li>
</ul>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>Q: Who can give an Open Space talk?<br>
A: Professionals, Lecturers, College Students - anyone who wishes to share.</p>
<p>Q: My talk is not selected for conference, can I opt for Open Space?<br>
A: Yes, this way people who are interested in the topic you proposed can catch up with you at the event itself.</p>
<p>Q: What is the screening process of an Open Space talk?<br>
A: No screening process, we are collecting information to facilitate logistics.</p></div>

        <div><p>Has contributing to Open source projects been one of those plans for you that just remained a plan? Or did you try contributing to an Open source project but got lost somewhere in the middle due to lack of guidance? 
Well, dev sprints are here to save the day! During Dev sprints, Mentors/Contributors of Open source projects guide participants through everything, from  generating the development build to submitting a patch for a bug.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you are a newbie or an experienced contributor, just dive in and get to work. It is also a great opportunity to understand and experience the ways of the Open source. Although, there will be situations when you might feel stuck, but there is nothing to worry about as the mentors present there can provide you instant help to get you moving. We can say this from experience, that participants of these dev sprints have not been limited to their Open source contribution just for the conference days.They are still active contributors.</p>
<p>If you are a contributor or have been involved in maintenance of any Open source project place, please come forward. You can submit your proposal for your Dev sprint <a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/dev-sprint-2017/proposals/">here</a>. This project can be any interesting Open source project which is based on Python. You should have enough contributions to the project. Your responsibility will be to help your team set up their development environment, list out beginner friendly bugs and guide them on any problems. Deadline for submitting call for proposals is [Date]. Don't hesitate to submit your proposals. Pycon India is Open for everyone.</p>
<p>The dev sprints will be conducted on 2nd and 3rd of November 2017.</p></div>
