    <div><p>A decade of unity in diversity presents - the 10th year anniversary edition of
PyCon India!</p>
<p>While a walk down memory lane would be apt at this point, let's keep the long
story short for now by saying we've done it! A conference started by volunteers,
handed and taken over from one group to another, from one city to another, we
start drawing another arc of the full circle this year when the conference
reaches back to its city of origin - Bangalore.</p>
<div class="section" id="dates">
<h2>Dates</h2>
<p>The Conference will be from August 22nd (Wednesday) to 26th (Sunday).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Conference  : 22nd (Wed) - 24th (Fri)</li>
<li>Workshop    : 25th (Sat) - 26th (Sun)</li>
<li>Dev sprints : 25th (Sat) - 26th (Sun)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="venue">
<h2>Venue</h2>
<p>We're moving to an even bigger and better venue this year - The Bangalore
International Exhibition Centre. It can take in a lot more people, has more
halls for multiple tracks, allows for easier movement between them and is
generally a whole lot bigger than all the other venues we've had so far.</p>
<p>[Bangalore International Exhibition Centre](<a class="reference external" href="http://biec.in/">http://biec.in/</a>)</p>
<p>10th Mile, Tumkur Road, Madavara Post,</p>
<p>Dasanapura Hobli,</p>
<p>Bangalore 562 123,</p>
<p>INDIA</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, the discussions and preparations are under full swing
already. While the conference along with the participation has evolved and grown
significantly over the years, none of that would've happened had we not pushed
to excel ourselves every single year. With that spirit, and a whole lot of
energy, let's look at a few things we're introducing this year.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="kids-track">
<h2>Kids' Track</h2>
<p>There hasn't been a better time in history for the young ones to learn and play
with programming. With an eye into the future, this year we intend to have a
dedicated Kids' Track where we welcome them, teach and let them build stuff over
the days of the conference.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="poster-sessions">
<h2>Poster Sessions</h2>
<p>While we already had Poster Sessions once before, it was only for a short 30
minutes. Since it was received very well, we're planning to have it again this
year; probably with more time and incentive for the presenters to get involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="career-booth">
<h2>Career Booth</h2>
<p>This is exclusively to help potential job seekers to find an opportunity at the
conference. The idea is to have a dedicated booth/stall to collect resumes and
contact information of those who want to get discovered by potential employers
and make a match between them. The finer details are yet to be finalised, but
we've received requests for the something of the sort over the years and we're
sure it'll help quite a few people.</p>
<p>That's about it for now!</p>
<p>In case your organisation is interested in meeting one of the most enthusiastic
Python crowds in all of India, be sure to checkout the sponsorship details. Not
only would you have access to meet these people face to face, but you will be
helping the community as a whole by supporting the conference financially and
making sure we can accommodate the widest possible audience.</p>
<p>For you budding speakers and teachers out there, prepare yourself mentally and
watch this space for the Call For Proposal announcement. We want to see your
proposals and we encourage people from all walks of life to submit talk/workshop
proposals despite your age, gender, experience and/or background. No one became
an expert overnight. So seize the opportunity and let's get you on that stage.</p>
<p>Now the question is...</p>
<p>Are * you * ready?</p>

    <div><p><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow™</a> is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.</p>

    <div><p>Every year PyCon India team strives hard to put effort making the conference better for participants. The current edition of PyCon India stretches for four days. The first two days filled with workshops and dev sprints, and last two days comprising a different version of talks.</p>
<p>The last edition had six workshops, and this edition has sixteen workshops. More workshops are exciting news for participants and present audience to attend workshops from a broad category.</p>
<p>For past few days, a lot of our audience expressed interest in attending multiple workshops on two days, but the price is a show stopper. After considering the request, the revised ticket price is 750 INR + taxes. Hope this will help you to participate in more workshops. The current workshop ticket holders will get a refund in the difference of amount after revised ticket fare. You can write to contact at in dot pycon dot org for any inquiries.</p>

    <div><p>PyCon India is run by volunteer and there have been innumerable people from various python communities from various parts of India who deserve kudos for their efforts in running the event for past nine years. There have been requests from communities in the past for space which we regrettably could not fulfil due to space constraints. This year too a lot of communities have asked for an area in the venue to exhibit their work. We are excited to take this opportunity to invite communities that are contributing to the ecosystem of Python to showcase themselves, their projects and activities at PyCon India 2017.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to showcase your work at PyCon India:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take part in <a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/dev-sprint-2017/proposals/">Dev Sprint</a> by submitting a proposal.</li>
<li>Give a lightning talk aka flash talks.</li>
<li>Register for a slot in open spaces.</li>
<li>Register for a community space</li>
</ul>
<p>In the area earmarked for community space, a booth with a table and chairs for two representatives shall be setup for each selected community. We encourage the representatives to bring a standee, sticker and information brochures to spread awareness about their work and contribution to the open source world.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that people should be aware of every community that support and sustain the python ecosystem at large. We hope that this would help the community gain much needed exposure and find new contributors which in turn shall strengthen the ecosystem. And what could be a better place for this than the premier Python conference of India, PyCon India 2017.</p>

    <div><p>Pycon India is back! It’s time to meet some amazing Pythonistas, share their experiences and learn a ton from some really inspiring like-minded open source enthusiasts. We are happy to inform you that we have decided to continue with our tradition of open space this year as well. Open spaces are not only a great way to create a vibrant community but also a really useful mode of sharing knowledge and learning from the same.</p>
<h3>What is an Open Space?</h3>
<p>Literally, it's a SPACE OPEN to anyone who wishes to talk about Python. Be it experience, learnings, libraries, tools, frameworks, tests, correct code practices, an idea, a "What-not-to-do" talk or anything (in this case about Python).</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Interested people can register for an open space talk. A time slot is allocated, the concerned person gives a talk during the allotted time. Audiences interact and discuss, sharing their opinions. Such small group discussions mostly turn out to be great.</p>
<h3>Why to pre-register?</h3>
<p>Just to make arrangements for rooms, projectors and other such requirements. On-spot registration is also allowed, provided there is time slot availability.</p>
<h3>How to participate in Open Space?</h3>
<p>Simply register yourself on the <a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/">PyCon India CFP</a> when it's announced. Remember you can also just walk in during the conference.</p>
<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li>Allowed time slot for each talk is 15-30 minutes.</li>
<li>Reach the talk arena, 5 minutes before your talk starts.</li>
<li>Please specify your requirements for the talk in CFP description.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Proposal Sections</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python 3k</strong> - Features, Python 2 to 3 migration experience, Writing compatible 2 and 3 code</li>
<li><strong>Web Development</strong> - Web Development, API design etc ...</li>
<li><strong>Standard library</strong> - Python Standard library features, usage</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure</strong> - Automation, Deployment</li>
<li><strong>Network Programming</strong> - Socket programming, Async IO, Twisted, Gevent</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Unit Testing, Selenium, py.test, Nose</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - Web Security, Server Security, Cryptography, Encryption</li>
<li><strong>Data Visualization and Analytics</strong> - Visualizations, Statistics, Big Data</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Computing</strong> - Scientific/Numeric Libraries</li>
<li><strong>Concurrency</strong> - Parallel Processing, Async IO</li>
<li><strong>Embedded Python</strong> - Embedded Python, Device Interfacing, Robotics, Raspberry Pi, Arduino</li>
<li><strong>Others</strong> - Others</li>
<li><strong>Core Python</strong> - Language Features, Python Implementations, Standard Library, Algorithms, C APIs</li>
</ul>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>Q: Who can give an Open Space talk?<br>
A: Professionals, Lecturers, College Students - anyone who wishes to share.</p>
<p>Q: My talk is not selected for conference, can I opt for Open Space?<br>
A: Yes, this way people who are interested in the topic you proposed can catch up with you at the event itself.</p>
<p>Q: What is the screening process of an Open Space talk?<br>
A: No screening process, we are collecting information to facilitate logistics.</p></div>

    <div><p>Has contributing to Open source projects been one of those plans for you that just remained a plan? Or did you try contributing to an Open source project but got lost somewhere in the middle due to lack of guidance? 
Well, dev sprints are here to save the day! During Dev sprints, Mentors/Contributors of Open source projects guide participants through everything, from  generating the development build to submitting a patch for a bug.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you are a newbie or an experienced contributor, just dive in and get to work. It is also a great opportunity to understand and experience the ways of the Open source. Although, there will be situations when you might feel stuck, but there is nothing to worry about as the mentors present there can provide you instant help to get you moving. We can say this from experience, that participants of these dev sprints have not been limited to their Open source contribution just for the conference days.They are still active contributors.</p>
<p>If you are a contributor or have been involved in maintenance of any Open source project place, please come forward. You can submit your proposal for your Dev sprint <a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/dev-sprint-2017/proposals/">here</a>. This project can be any interesting Open source project which is based on Python. You should have enough contributions to the project. Your responsibility will be to help your team set up their development environment, list out beginner friendly bugs and guide them on any problems. Deadline for submitting call for proposals is [Date]. Don't hesitate to submit your proposals. Pycon India is Open for everyone.</p>
<p>The dev sprints will be conducted on 2nd and 3rd of November 2017.</p></div>

<p><img alt="Vijay Kumar" src="https://in.pycon.org/2015/images/team/Vijay-Kumar-400x400.jpg" /></p>
<p>Vijay works as an embedded software developer &amp; trainer at <a href="http://www.zilogic.com/">Zilogic Systems</a>. Apart from developing Python based embedded systems based on <a href="http://www.telit.com/">Telit</a> and Embedded Linux there, he also contributes to the development of in-house Python based build and test automation frameworks. To add to that, he trains people in Embedded Linux and device driver development as well.</p>
<p>Vijay's community building activities and involvement goes back more than a decade! He helped create the GNU/Linux User Group of Trichy, back in 2001, when he was an undergrad at NIT Trichy. Since then, he has been promoting Free and Open Source Software, by helping organize meetups, workshops, demo days, and conferences. He got associated with <a href="http://chennaipy.org/">Chennaipy</a> in 2010, and in mid-2011 helped coordinate its activities. For the past 1.5 years, Chennaipy has been put in overdrive mode, rapidly expanding in quality of the meetups, and the diversity of the people attending it.</p>
<p>During his spare time, apart from being a backbone of building the FOSS and Python community in India, he contributes to a myriad of open source projects. To list a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>He has contributed to porting U-Boot and the Linux Kernel to the <a href="http://www.qca.qualcomm.com/networking/connected-home/internet-processors/">IPQ806x platform</a>, a Qualcomm Snapdragon variant.</li>
<li>Patch contributions to Qemu, and the <a href="https://linux-test-project.github.io/">Linux Testing Project</a>.</li>
<li>Also maintains the Free Software tutorials <a href="http://bravegnu.org/gnu-eprog/">"Embedded Programming with the GNU Toolchain"</a> and <a href="http://bravegnu.org/gtktext/">"GTK+ Multi-line Text Editing Widget."</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a proud moment indeed when you're recognized for all those years of passionate work that you did for the betterment of everyone around you. Our heartfelt congratulations to Vijay Kumar, and we wish him all success and a bright future ahead. We hope the younger generation takes inspiration from his works and contribute more to improve the Free Software and Python programming community.</p></div>

    <a href="/inpycon-blog/output/blog/2015/poster-presentation-2015.html">
        <h1 class="title"> Call for Posters for Poster Presentation</h1>
    </a>
    <div class='meta'><time datetime="2015-09-04 13:05:00+05:30" itemprop="datePublished"><small>Published: September 04, 2015</small></time></div>

    <div><h2>What is Poster Presentation?</h2>
<p>Poster presentation/session is an informal way to present your ideas, or research information at the conference with an academic focus and reach out to a larger audience on your topic. Basically the poster presentations are different from the soft, projector based presentations, where the  presenter/individual/speaker accompanies a poster, posts it on a black/white board in the space provided, stand there, talk to the rolling audience, explain the concept, take maximum questions on his topic. Each presentation is usually presented over a period of 10 minutes or more.
Interestingly, at PyCon 2015, Bangalore, we’ll be having the Poster sessions and space will be reserved for the speakers to display their posters.</p>
<h2>What is the Motivation behind it?</h2>
<p>Oral presentations are a richer medium than written documents. They allow you to establish stronger contact with the audience and better convince them with your viewpoint through verbal and nonverbal methods, as well as the ensuing interaction. Posters also act as hard copies providing in-depth details of the concepts of a talk a speaker aims to spread, where any participant can look back incase he missed a few pointers during the talk.</p>
<h2>Who can Participate?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Professionals</li>
<li>Lecturers</li>
<li>College Students</li>
<li>Speakers</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to submit Posters?</h2>
<p>Through Junction:
<a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-2015-poster-session/proposals/">https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-2015-poster-session/proposals/</a></p>
<h2>What makes a good Poster Presentation?</h2>
<p>First and most important, a good proposal. Poster sessions are intended to give you the chance to present interesting ideas and start conversations with others. Additionally, proposal titles and abstracts are one of the major tools the audience will use to identify posters of interest.
Second, the poster itself. The poster is a visual aid for you to use in creating a quick engaging presentation, and to refer to it answering questions and fuelling discussion.</p>
<h2>Rules and Guidelines:</h2>
<p>Certain Rules and guidelines that are suggested for an ideal poster presentation include:</p>
<h3>Define the purpose</h3>
<p>Heading should convey the entire message of your idea</p>
<h3>Your message</h3>
<p>Sell your idea in seconds</p>
<h3>Poster size</h3>
<p>Not too big, not too small</p>
<h3>Include Images, Graphs</h3>
<p>It’ll make the presentation more informative</p>
<h3>Presentation Index should look like:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Introduction/Goal</li>
<li>Methods</li>
<li>Results</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
<li>References</li>
<li>Few links of your references for the audience to get proper enlightenment of your idea and to understand it thoroughly</li>
<li>Acknowledgement</li>
<li>Thanking the audience for their attention provides a nice segue into the question and answer session.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Poster selection is the beginning</h3>
<p>Consider the post presentation impact of your topic.</p>
<h3>QR Code</h3>
<p>You do not have to use a QR, but it adds a level of professionalism to your work. It is often put in lower right hand corner with other contact information.</p>
<h3>Literature Review</h3>
<p>Existing systems. Advantage of your idea over them.</p>
<h3>Writing Style</h3>
<p>Proper fonts and colors wherever needed</p>
<h3>Design, Layout</h3>
<p>Poster content is always arranged in columns, on an invisible grid</p>
<h3>FAQs</h3>
<h3>Q: Can I submit both a poster and a talk proposal?</h3>
<p>A: Absolutely! We encourage everyone to submit a poster proposal even if they have also submitted a talk proposal. If both are accepted, we encourage authors to adapt their presentation to make the best use of each venue. Even if a talk proposal can not be accommodated by the program committee, it may still be well suited for a poster presentation.</p></div>

    <div><p>Just under 2 months to go for this year's <a href="https://in.pycon.org/2015/">PyCon India</a>. As we had <a href="https://in.pycon.org/blog/2015/dev-sprint.html">announced earlier</a>, this year we are holding Dev Sprints as a part of the conference. A big thank you, to all of you for filling out the form.</p>
<p>In case you are confused or if we sound too pretentious, think of Dev sprint as having a good time, coding hands-on with your fellow Python programmers. The atmosphere will be that of an intense one, extremely focused on projects, with mentors hanging around to help you overcome any roadblock that you might face. The usual outcome of these intense sprints are patches, bug fixes and numerous upstream pull requests from almost all the participants.</p>
<p>Been dreaming about contributing to open source projects? Well, look no further because there won't be a better chance than this. The Sprint will be held on <strong>Oct 2nd from 9Am - 7.30 PM on the 1st floor of the conference venue</strong>. We will open participant registrations next month.</p>
<p><a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-dev-sprint-2015/proposals/">Meanwhile, we have opened the CFP for the dev sprints!</a></p>
<p>If you have a project which you can mentor for, then please add your project and its description in the proposal page linked to above. Projects can include any personal ones that contribute to the Python ecosystem or mainstream projects such as CPython, Django, Flask, Pandas, SymPy etc. Be sure to make one proposal per project and also one proposal per mentor as well.</p>
<p>Once we close the CFP, we will make a list of the accepted projects and the participants will be able to choose from them while they participate in the event.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you have not purchased your conference tickets already, <a href="https://in.explara.com/e/pycon-india-2015">get them soon!</a></p></div>

        <h1 class="title"> Nominations open for the Kenneth Gonsalves 2015 award</h1>
    </a>
    <div class='meta'><time datetime="2015-07-13 10:00:00+05:30" itemprop="datePublished"><small>Published: July 13, 2015</small></time></div>

    <div><p>Ladies &amp; Gentlemen,</p>
<p>There is always a need to identify figures whom the coming generations can look upto. For this purpose, and to encourage even further contributions, as well as to motivate the upcoming generations, we have been consistently awarding the Kenneth Gonsalves award for the past two years to worthy Indian Pythonistas.</p>
<p><a href="https://in.pycon.org/2013/blog/baijum-first-kenneth-gonsalves-award-recipient/">Baiju Muthukadan was the first year's recipient</a>. <a href="https://in.pycon.org/2014/blog/prabhu-ramachandran-is-winner-of-kenneth-gonsalves-award-2014/">Last year, it was awarded to Prabhu Ramachandran</a>.</p>
<p>This award is instituted by PSSI and PSF in the name of our late friend and mentor, Kenneth Gonsalves who passed away in August 2012. KG, as he is fondly known in the community, was the founder of the Indian Python Software Society. This award is for the ones who are doing exemplary work in Python programming language, its development/adoption/advocacy in India.</p>
<p>It is that time of the year, again,  where we welcome nominations for a worthy candidate from all of you. If you know someone who has played a key role in the Indian Python community's development, please nominate their names. Do your part to help us find a deserving personality to accept the award this year.</p>

    <div><p>Providing child care at <a href="http://in.pycon.org/">PyCon India</a> is something that has been on our minds for more than a few years now. Empowering the parents to attend the talks and network around the conference tension free, knowing that their children are in good hands. This year we've teamed up with professionals in order to make this happen and hope to give the kids a nice time as well during the conference!</p>
<p>If you would like to sign up for this service, please choose <code>Yes</code> for the question <code>Would you like to avail Child care facility?</code>, which will be asked during <a href="https://in.explara.com/e/pycon-india-2015">online registration</a>.</p>
<p>While we'd love every parent attending the conference to take advantage of this service, we have to keep in mind the Venue bandwidth and man power as well. Those being taken into consideration, we only have 25 slots, which will be offered on a First Come First Serve basis. So if you would like to sign up for it, we suggest you to fill in your name right away!</p>
<p>We will personally start reaching out to the parents who have opted for this service a month before the conference in order to understand their specific expectations better. The fee for the service is Rs. 500 per day per child.</p>
<p>Just to add to that, why not give your kids a chance to watch their parents stand up and teach a lot of people? <a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-2015/proposals/">Go ahead and propose a session, will ya?</a></p>

That, my friends, is going to be fixed this year!</p>
<p><a href="https://bit.ly/dev-sprint-survey">Do take a moment to fill up this 1-minute Dev sprint survey form.</a></p>
<p>We are planning on conducting Dev sprints all across India within Local User Groups starting from this month onwards. If you would like to participate or offer suggestions, please join the <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/inpycon">inpycon mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Tentatively, the plan is to hold the sprints on October 2nd, Friday, parallel to the workshops. We will make the announcement as soon as the plan is finalized.</p>

<p>PyCon India is one of <em>the</em> most affordable and entirely community run professional conferences in India, and we strive to keep it that way.

<ol>
<li>Early Python          : Rs. 1000 (150 tickets. No cancellation. Transferable)</li>
<li>Regular Python        : Rs. 1200 </li>
<li>Late Python           : Rs. 1800</li>
<li>Student Python        : Rs. 1000</li>
<li>On-the-spot Python    : Rs. 2500 (For two days)</li>
<li>Workshop Python       : Rs. 1000 Per workshop</li>
</ol>
<p>Tickets 1 to 5 gives you full access to the conference for two days, including breakfast, lunch, tea &amp; snacks and a T-shirt. The workshop ticket has to be bought separately for each workshop that you want to attend. We'll announce them as soon as we finalize them.</p>

        <h1 class="title"> Volunteering for PyCon India</h1>
    </a>
    <div class='meta'><time datetime="2015-03-16 12:23:00+05:30" itemprop="datePublished"><small>Published: March 16, 2015</small></time></div>

    <div><p><a href="http://in.pycon.org/">PyCon India</a> is a community event. Here each and every task is done by a volunteer. And here is the opportunity for You to be a part of the community.</p>
<p>But before you register to volunteer, there are few things you should be aware of -</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Volunteering takes time and effort, sometimes a lot of it. For online activities like handling social networks or handling registrations etc take a lot of time. And sometimes rapid decisions have to be made. So if you're volunteering, make sure you have the time. If you're unavailable at certain time period of the day, let us know beforehand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're volunteering for offline activities e.g. on spot registration or settings up stages or handling video recording, anything that has to be done on the venue during the event, there is a good chance that you won't be able to attend the sessions you just registered for. If someone needs you, you have to be there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volunteering is not a free way into the event. At PyCon India, everybody buys tickets. Even the event organizers buy tickets. We volunteer because we love Python and PyCon, and want the event to be awesome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volunteers are the most important part of the event. Without the volunteers, the event cannot happen. So even if you are attending PyCon for the first time, we encourage you to volunteer with whatever you can. If you don't want to miss any sessions, then volunteer for smaller tasks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're still interested in volunteering, subscribe to <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/inpycon">the mailing list</a>. <strong>Please don't subscribe to the daily digest</strong>. Digests are always behind the time and meant for those who just wants to stay updated and not participate in conversations. If you're already subscribed to the mailing list, <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/inpycon">go ahead, login</a> and change your subscription type. Also, <strong>please don't reply to a digest</strong>.</p>
<p>Once your name is on the form, keep an eye on the mailing list. Threads will be created on specific tasks asking for volunteers. If you think you can do the task and have enough time for it, raise your hand. That's it.</p>
<p>Also, if you have any question, we'd really appreciate if you go through the <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/inpycon/">mailing list archives</a> first, and see if it's already answered. If not, you can talk to us at the IRC channel <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23pyconindia">#pyconindia</a> on <a href="http://freenode.net/">freenode.net</a> or send a mail to the mailing list.</p>
<p>Hope to see you at the event. Happy volunteering. :)</p></div>

    <div><p>Buckle up people, the PyCon India 2015 ride is here! Mark your calendars for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th of October 2015. We have already launched our <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2015/">website</a> last month, announced our <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2015/sponsorship.html">call for sponsorship</a> and just recently opened the <a href="http://in.pycon.org/blog/2015/call-for-proposals.html">call for proposals</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see, we have started the prep early to make sure we take this year's conference a notch above last year's. With over a 1000 attendees last time, we are sure to hit house full this year as well, the upper limit being ~1200, which is, sadly, the conference venue's maximum capacity.</p>
<p>If you have a company, or work at one who would be interested in meeting one of the most enthusiastic Python crowds, then be sure to check out the sponsorship details. Apart from that, this is an opportunity for you to give back and show your support for the community's growth as well.</p>
<p>In case you are brimming with excitement about teaching or talking about anything Python, no matter whether you started yesterday or have been using Python for a decade, make sure you put in a talk proposal. No one became an expert in a day - neither at presenting nor at programming. So don't be shy and don't think too much. Just put in a proposal, yes, right now!</p>
<p>Here are a few important dates to keep in mind. We shall try our best to adhere to these dates, but hey, as you know, all of us are volunteers here.</p>
