            <h1 class="title"> Winner of the 2015 Kenneth Gonsalves Award - Vijay Kumar!</h1>
        </a>
        <div class='meta'><time datetime="2015-09-23 10:00:00+05:30" itemprop="datePublished"><small>Published: September 23, 2015</small></time></div>

        <div><p>The <a href="http://pssi.org.in/">PSSI</a> is both happy and proud to announce <a href="http://www.bravegnu.org/">Vijay Kumar</a> as the winner of this year's <a href="https://in.pycon.org/blog/2015/kenneth-gonsalves-2015.html">Kenneth Gonsalves Award</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Vijay Kumar" src="https://in.pycon.org/2015/images/team/Vijay-Kumar-400x400.jpg" /></p>
<p>Vijay works as an embedded software developer &amp; trainer at <a href="http://www.zilogic.com/">Zilogic Systems</a>. Apart from developing Python based embedded systems based on <a href="http://www.telit.com/">Telit</a> and Embedded Linux there, he also contributes to the development of in-house Python based build and test automation frameworks. To add to that, he trains people in Embedded Linux and device driver development as well.</p>
<p>Vijay's community building activities and involvement goes back more than a decade! He helped create the GNU/Linux User Group of Trichy, back in 2001, when he was an undergrad at NIT Trichy. Since then, he has been promoting Free and Open Source Software, by helping organize meetups, workshops, demo days, and conferences. He got associated with <a href="http://chennaipy.org/">Chennaipy</a> in 2010, and in mid-2011 helped coordinate its activities. For the past 1.5 years, Chennaipy has been put in overdrive mode, rapidly expanding in quality of the meetups, and the diversity of the people attending it.</p>
<p>During his spare time, apart from being a backbone of building the FOSS and Python community in India, he contributes to a myriad of open source projects. To list a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>He has contributed to porting U-Boot and the Linux Kernel to the <a href="http://www.qca.qualcomm.com/networking/connected-home/internet-processors/">IPQ806x platform</a>, a Qualcomm Snapdragon variant.</li>
<li>Patch contributions to Qemu, and the <a href="https://linux-test-project.github.io/">Linux Testing Project</a>.</li>
<li>Also maintains the Free Software tutorials <a href="http://bravegnu.org/gnu-eprog/">"Embedded Programming with the GNU Toolchain"</a> and <a href="http://bravegnu.org/gtktext/">"GTK+ Multi-line Text Editing Widget."</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a proud moment indeed when you're recognized for all those years of passionate work that you did for the betterment of everyone around you. Our heartfelt congratulations to Vijay Kumar, and we wish him all success and a bright future ahead. We hope the younger generation takes inspiration from his works and contribute more to improve the Free Software and Python programming community.</p></div>

        <a href="/inpycon-blog/output/blog/2015/poster-presentation-2015.html">
            <h1 class="title"> Call for Posters for Poster Presentation</h1>
        </a>
        <div class='meta'><time datetime="2015-09-04 13:05:00+05:30" itemprop="datePublished"><small>Published: September 04, 2015</small></time></div>

        <div><h2>What is Poster Presentation?</h2>
<p>Poster presentation/session is an informal way to present your ideas, or research information at the conference with an academic focus and reach out to a larger audience on your topic. Basically the poster presentations are different from the soft, projector based presentations, where the  presenter/individual/speaker accompanies a poster, posts it on a black/white board in the space provided, stand there, talk to the rolling audience, explain the concept, take maximum questions on his topic. Each presentation is usually presented over a period of 10 minutes or more.
Interestingly, at PyCon 2015, Bangalore, we’ll be having the Poster sessions and space will be reserved for the speakers to display their posters.</p>
<h2>What is the Motivation behind it?</h2>
<p>Oral presentations are a richer medium than written documents. They allow you to establish stronger contact with the audience and better convince them with your viewpoint through verbal and nonverbal methods, as well as the ensuing interaction. Posters also act as hard copies providing in-depth details of the concepts of a talk a speaker aims to spread, where any participant can look back incase he missed a few pointers during the talk.</p>
<h2>Who can Participate?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Professionals</li>
<li>Lecturers</li>
<li>College Students</li>
<li>Speakers</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to submit Posters?</h2>
<p>Through Junction:
<a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-2015-poster-session/proposals/">https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-2015-poster-session/proposals/</a></p>
<h2>What makes a good Poster Presentation?</h2>
<p>First and most important, a good proposal. Poster sessions are intended to give you the chance to present interesting ideas and start conversations with others. Additionally, proposal titles and abstracts are one of the major tools the audience will use to identify posters of interest.
Second, the poster itself. The poster is a visual aid for you to use in creating a quick engaging presentation, and to refer to it answering questions and fuelling discussion.</p>
<h2>Rules and Guidelines:</h2>
<p>Certain Rules and guidelines that are suggested for an ideal poster presentation include:</p>
<h3>Define the purpose</h3>
<p>Heading should convey the entire message of your idea</p>
<h3>Your message</h3>
<p>Sell your idea in seconds</p>
<h3>Poster size</h3>
<p>Not too big, not too small</p>
<h3>Include Images, Graphs</h3>
<p>It’ll make the presentation more informative</p>
<h3>Presentation Index should look like:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Introduction/Goal</li>
<li>Methods</li>
<li>Results</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
<li>References</li>
<li>Few links of your references for the audience to get proper enlightenment of your idea and to understand it thoroughly</li>
<li>Acknowledgement</li>
<li>Thanking the audience for their attention provides a nice segue into the question and answer session.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Poster selection is the beginning</h3>
<p>Consider the post presentation impact of your topic.</p>
<h3>QR Code</h3>
<p>You do not have to use a QR, but it adds a level of professionalism to your work. It is often put in lower right hand corner with other contact information.</p>
<h3>Literature Review</h3>
<p>Existing systems. Advantage of your idea over them.</p>
<h3>Writing Style</h3>
<p>Proper fonts and colors wherever needed</p>
<h3>Design, Layout</h3>
<p>Poster content is always arranged in columns, on an invisible grid</p>
<h3>FAQs</h3>
<h3>Q: Can I submit both a poster and a talk proposal?</h3>
<p>A: Absolutely! We encourage everyone to submit a poster proposal even if they have also submitted a talk proposal. If both are accepted, we encourage authors to adapt their presentation to make the best use of each venue. Even if a talk proposal can not be accommodated by the program committee, it may still be well suited for a poster presentation.</p></div>

        <div><p>Just under 2 months to go for this year's <a href="https://in.pycon.org/2015/">PyCon India</a>. As we had <a href="https://in.pycon.org/blog/2015/dev-sprint.html">announced earlier</a>, this year we are holding Dev Sprints as a part of the conference. A big thank you, to all of you for filling out the form.</p>
<p>In case you are confused or if we sound too pretentious, think of Dev sprint as having a good time, coding hands-on with your fellow Python programmers. The atmosphere will be that of an intense one, extremely focused on projects, with mentors hanging around to help you overcome any roadblock that you might face. The usual outcome of these intense sprints are patches, bug fixes and numerous upstream pull requests from almost all the participants.</p>
<p>Been dreaming about contributing to open source projects? Well, look no further because there won't be a better chance than this. The Sprint will be held on <strong>Oct 2nd from 9Am - 7.30 PM on the 1st floor of the conference venue</strong>. We will open participant registrations next month.</p>
<p><a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-dev-sprint-2015/proposals/">Meanwhile, we have opened the CFP for the dev sprints!</a></p>
<p>If you have a project which you can mentor for, then please add your project and its description in the proposal page linked to above. Projects can include any personal ones that contribute to the Python ecosystem or mainstream projects such as CPython, Django, Flask, Pandas, SymPy etc. Be sure to make one proposal per project and also one proposal per mentor as well.</p>
<p>Once we close the CFP, we will make a list of the accepted projects and the participants will be able to choose from them while they participate in the event.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you have not purchased your conference tickets already, <a href="https://in.explara.com/e/pycon-india-2015">get them soon!</a></p></div>

        <div class='meta'><time datetime="2015-07-13 10:00:00+05:30" itemprop="datePublished"><small>Published: July 13, 2015</small></time></div>

        <div><p>Ladies &amp; Gentlemen,</p>
<p>There is always a need to identify figures whom the coming generations can look upto. For this purpose, and to encourage even further contributions, as well as to motivate the upcoming generations, we have been consistently awarding the Kenneth Gonsalves award for the past two years to worthy Indian Pythonistas.</p>
<p><a href="https://in.pycon.org/2013/blog/baijum-first-kenneth-gonsalves-award-recipient/">Baiju Muthukadan was the first year's recipient</a>. <a href="https://in.pycon.org/2014/blog/prabhu-ramachandran-is-winner-of-kenneth-gonsalves-award-2014/">Last year, it was awarded to Prabhu Ramachandran</a>.</p>
<p>This award is instituted by PSSI and PSF in the name of our late friend and mentor, Kenneth Gonsalves who passed away in August 2012. KG, as he is fondly known in the community, was the founder of the Indian Python Software Society. This award is for the ones who are doing exemplary work in Python programming language, its development/adoption/advocacy in India.</p>
<p>It is that time of the year, again,  where we welcome nominations for a worthy candidate from all of you. If you know someone who has played a key role in the Indian Python community's development, please nominate their names. Do your part to help us find a deserving personality to accept the award this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://pssi.org.in/nomination/KG2015/">Please submit your nominations here.</a></p></div>

        </a>
        <div class='meta'><time datetime="2015-05-17 10:00:00+05:30" itemprop="datePublished"><small>Published: May 17, 2015</small></time></div>

        <div><p>Providing child care at <a href="http://in.pycon.org/">PyCon India</a> is something that has been on our minds for more than a few years now. Empowering the parents to attend the talks and network around the conference tension free, knowing that their children are in good hands. This year we've teamed up with professionals in order to make this happen and hope to give the kids a nice time as well during the conference!</p>
<p>If you would like to sign up for this service, please choose <code>Yes</code> for the question <code>Would you like to avail Child care facility?</code>, which will be asked during <a href="https://in.explara.com/e/pycon-india-2015">online registration</a>.</p>
<p>While we'd love every parent attending the conference to take advantage of this service, we have to keep in mind the Venue bandwidth and man power as well. Those being taken into consideration, we only have 25 slots, which will be offered on a First Come First Serve basis. So if you would like to sign up for it, we suggest you to fill in your name right away!</p>
<p>We will personally start reaching out to the parents who have opted for this service a month before the conference in order to understand their specific expectations better. The fee for the service is Rs. 500 per day per child.</p>
<p>Just to add to that, why not give your kids a chance to watch their parents stand up and teach a lot of people? <a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-2015/proposals/">Go ahead and propose a session, will ya?</a></p>

        <div><p>When we say we strive to make <a href="https://in.pycon.org/2015/">PyCon India</a> better, we mean it. Concentrating on talk qualities, being inclusive and then getting onto having top notch workshops, believe it or not, PyCon India has never had a Dev Sprint. That, my friends, is going to be fixed this year!</p>
<p><a href="https://bit.ly/dev-sprint-survey">Do take a moment to fill up this 1-minute Dev sprint survey form.</a></p>
<p>We are planning on conducting Dev sprints all across India within Local User Groups starting from this month onwards. If you would like to participate or offer suggestions, please join the <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/inpycon">inpycon mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Tentatively, the plan is to hold the sprints on October 2nd, Friday, parallel to the workshops. We will make the announcement as soon as the plan is finalized.</p>
<p>Don't forget to <a href="https://in.explara.com/e/pycon-india-2015">grab your tickets</a> and <a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-2015/proposals/">put in a talk proposal</a> though!</p></div>

<p>PyCon India is one of <em>the</em> most affordable and entirely community run professional conferences in India, and we strive to keep it that way. As much as we try, inflation is just something that we can't do much about and hence, the small changes will reflect. Here are the pricing tiers for this year's conference:</p>
<ol>
<li>Early Python          : Rs. 1000 (150 tickets. No cancellation. Transferable)</li>
<li>Regular Python        : Rs. 1200 </li>
<li>Late Python           : Rs. 1800</li>
<li>Student Python        : Rs. 1000</li>
<li>On-the-spot Python    : Rs. 2500 (For two days)</li>
<li>Workshop Python       : Rs. 1000 Per workshop</li>
</ol>
<p>Tickets 1 to 5 gives you full access to the conference for two days, including breakfast, lunch, tea &amp; snacks and a T-shirt. The workshop ticket has to be bought separately for each workshop that you want to attend. We'll announce them as soon as we finalize them.</p>

<p>If you would like to talk Python at the conference, <a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-2015/proposals/">take a look at our Proposal submission page</a>. Put in a rough draft right away. You can think about prettifying it later on. Submissions deadline is on the 31st of May.</p>

            <h1 class="title"> Volunteering for PyCon India</h1>
        </a>
        <div class='meta'><time datetime="2015-03-16 12:23:00+05:30" itemprop="datePublished"><small>Published: March 16, 2015</small></time></div>

        <div><p><a href="http://in.pycon.org/">PyCon India</a> is a community event. Here each and every task is done by a volunteer. And here is the opportunity for You to be a part of the community.</p>
<p>But before you register to volunteer, there are few things you should be aware of -</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Volunteering takes time and effort, sometimes a lot of it. For online activities like handling social networks or handling registrations etc take a lot of time. And sometimes rapid decisions have to be made. So if you're volunteering, make sure you have the time. If you're unavailable at certain time period of the day, let us know beforehand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're volunteering for offline activities e.g. on spot registration or settings up stages or handling video recording, anything that has to be done on the venue during the event, there is a good chance that you won't be able to attend the sessions you just registered for. If someone needs you, you have to be there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volunteering is not a free way into the event. At PyCon India, everybody buys tickets. Even the event organizers buy tickets. We volunteer because we love Python and PyCon, and want the event to be awesome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volunteers are the most important part of the event. Without the volunteers, the event cannot happen. So even if you are attending PyCon for the first time, we encourage you to volunteer with whatever you can. If you don't want to miss any sessions, then volunteer for smaller tasks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're still interested in volunteering, subscribe to <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/inpycon">the mailing list</a>. <strong>Please don't subscribe to the daily digest</strong>. Digests are always behind the time and meant for those who just wants to stay updated and not participate in conversations. If you're already subscribed to the mailing list, <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/inpycon">go ahead, login</a> and change your subscription type. Also, <strong>please don't reply to a digest</strong>.</p>
<p>Once your name is on the form, keep an eye on the mailing list. Threads will be created on specific tasks asking for volunteers. If you think you can do the task and have enough time for it, raise your hand. That's it.</p>
<p>Also, if you have any question, we'd really appreciate if you go through the <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/inpycon/">mailing list archives</a> first, and see if it's already answered. If not, you can talk to us at the IRC channel <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23pyconindia">#pyconindia</a> on <a href="http://freenode.net/">freenode.net</a> or send a mail to the mailing list.</p>
<p>Hope to see you at the event. Happy volunteering. :)</p></div>

        <div><p>Buckle up people, the PyCon India 2015 ride is here! Mark your calendars for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th of October 2015. We have already launched our <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2015/">website</a> last month, announced our <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2015/sponsorship.html">call for sponsorship</a> and just recently opened the <a href="http://in.pycon.org/blog/2015/call-for-proposals.html">call for proposals</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see, we have started the prep early to make sure we take this year's conference a notch above last year's. With over a 1000 attendees last time, we are sure to hit house full this year as well, the upper limit being ~1200, which is, sadly, the conference venue's maximum capacity.</p>
<p>If you have a company, or work at one who would be interested in meeting one of the most enthusiastic Python crowds, then be sure to check out the sponsorship details. Apart from that, this is an opportunity for you to give back and show your support for the community's growth as well.</p>
<p>In case you are brimming with excitement about teaching or talking about anything Python, no matter whether you started yesterday or have been using Python for a decade, make sure you put in a talk proposal. No one became an expert in a day - neither at presenting nor at programming. So don't be shy and don't think too much. Just put in a proposal, yes, right now!</p>
<p>Here are a few important dates to keep in mind. We shall try our best to adhere to these dates, but hey, as you know, all of us are volunteers here.</p>
